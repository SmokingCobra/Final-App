# Final-App

App I designed and created for my final project in my App development class. Took third place at the culminating showcase. 

This app acts as a digital portfolio, or business card, for my musical career so far in my life. Included in the app are 
songs from 4 different artists I’ve recorded with, a list of gear I use and information on it, and a map highlighting 
venues that I’ve played at.

Designed for 7-8in tablets.
